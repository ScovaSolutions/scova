I looked back last night, at some of my pictures from that time. They were all taken at some competition, or at some social event – looking at them, you surely wouldn't not be able to verify my description of that time – because who take a picture of their kid when they come home from school, having crapper their shorts?

Not that they didn’t adhere\n                    to my likings whenever I asked them for something – this particular\n                    decision was one that would shape the rest of my path. For the first time,\n                    I was outside Ludhiana on my own. I didn’t know it yet, but in St George’s\n                    College, I would be known and associated with the <em>space</em> I had\n                    never myself associated with, all my life.\n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    I was one of the few Indian Sikh kids, and out of that very small group, I\n                    was the only turbaned Sikh kid from Punjab in my class. At the time, a\n                    class was the biggest social group a kid could hope to be a part of. So,\n                    for the first time – my also mind wandered towards defining myself in terms\n                    of my religion, the only group that I could be a part of and yet stay my\n                    unique self.

What is one such group? The answer is\t<em>always religion</em>. Your relationship with God makes you one out of a\n                    million others (read: similar) who relate to God in the way that you do,\n                    but also, because of your personal relationship with Him, you still remain\n                    one in a million (read: unique).\n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n\n                    I remember the first time we, as a family, went out of the country – to our supposed \"enemy\" country of Pakistan. We went there for a couple days to watch a single cricket match that spanned a couple days. I want to call it a test-match, but I'm not sure cricket will remain relevant for posterity. Maybe it will, so I will not be talking about why an actual competitive game is called a \"test\" match. My family (apart from my father) were not particularly interested in cricket, but we went along anyway, because travel was convenient (we literally crossed the border on foot), and the tickets for the match didn't cost all that much (can't say the same for our accommodation). Really though, we went because we weren't aware of the instability that was the norm within the country at the time. This was before the internet had saturated our lives. \n\n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    Outside the stadium, where our cab driver dropped us off, there was a group of young guys, doing <em>bhangra</em> with the traditional <em>dhol</em>. They were <em>Punjabi</em>, just like us, so this was a welcome sight. They called out to my father with the calls of <em>\"oho sardarji, aao ji,\"</em> signalling to my turbaned father, to come and join them in the dance. My father, who appeared to me an ignorant simpleton at the time, wilfully complied. After the deed was done, and we were making our way to the stadium again, all of us realized at nearly the same moment, that they were actually making fun of my father, and told him to not partake in such tomfoolery again – to which my father replied that he didn't really have a choice. He didn't want to turn the group into an angry mob, so he plastered a smile, and indulged them. \n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    A couple of obvious things stand out to me now, when this incident has been brought to my attention at this particular junction in the chapter. The first being that my father was only called at, because of his perceived difference. Had he not been wearing a turban, the crowd would not have realised that we were different from them, and hence, would not have had any reason to bother a family to partake in their diversion.

The third being, that he was called out with kind salutations of \"ji,\" which is used when you are referring to someone respectfully. Fourth, the use of the term \"sardar,\" which, initially adopted for its revered stature, was now often used in a derogatory context, alluding to the supposed stereotype of a stupid-sardar, who couldn't understand the nuances of a situation, and was often looked at as a simpleton. \n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    It is weird, that this idea of the simpleton sardar originated towards the end of Mughal India, almost definitely during the period of annexation of Delhi, by the Iranian Muslim ruler, Nader Shah. The story goes, that around the year 1739 CE, the Shah's men were not only looting treasures during their conquests, but also taking Hindu women hostage. Sardar Jassa Singh, commander of the Sikh army at that time, decided to attack Nader Shah’s troops at midnight. It began a series of extractions, where the Sikh army would attack Muslim raiders at midnight, and bring back the women to their homes. That whole series of occurrences began a smear campaign, probably starting of as a deprecating joke arising out of insecurity and contempt, about sardars going mad at midnight. To this day, turbaned sikhs, all over the world have to be the butt of those jokes about being stupid, especially more so, when the clock is about to strike 12. \n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    I mention this, not to gain sympathy, certainly not to reignite religious tensions – 11 year old me was mightily affected by the riots that broke out in the city on the day we were scheduled to leave Pakistan, than by this minor brush with discrimination. Markets were closed, not a single uninvolved bystander was to be seen, every turn we took just led to a wall of lynching crowd – cracking windows, and burning tyres. My father had to remove his turban, and my sisters were hidden from outside view. God knows what their issue was at the time, but years later when I recounted this issue to a Pakistani friend of mine, he scoffed \"unka roz ka hai, aap hamare ghar aaye, khatirdaari karenge\" – <em>this is usual for them, you should come to our house sometime, you'll be well taken care of.</em> I'm assuming he meant people of Lahore in general, but he could very well be talking about a particular faction. I can't remember, we were sufficiently baked. The trip to Pakistan too, would've been erased from memory, had it not been for these two occurrences. We had a pre-planned vacation to Malaysia and Singapore just a day later, so that overwrote a bunch of trauma.

Really though, I wanted to point out the intricate irrationality that is reflected in each of our ignorant actions, especially more so in the case of discrimination, positive or negative. Think about all the different ways in which we have to alter the flow of our regular routines to accommodate others who aren't aware of the implications of their own actions. I'm absolutely sure, that there isn't a single person on this planet, who has not faced discrimination – it is the baggage that we inherited, but were not born with. It is time to let that go. We are all the same here. Why don't we treat each other well? What's the point of enemity when all known territory has been conquered, and is under some administration?

Once you\n                    discovered drugs that lead you to insightful thoughts and a disconnect from\n                    the world – all without doing the work, it seemed like there would be no\n                    turning back. You wanted drugs in your system as much as was humanly\n                    possible. At times, even more than humanly possible.\n                <br/><br/>\n                    With each successive hit of the drug, your desire to take more of it only\n                    grew. Your social life, your daily routines, all were now focused around\n                    the consumption of this drug. And when that was not enough, you switched up\n                    to other, more immediately harmful drugs. All this time you have gotten a\n                    good reason to explain your drug habits – psychedelics, the final frontier.\n                <br/><br/>\n                    Without it, you could not have reached Me (<em>or so you think</em>). And\n                    without it, you would not have realised all that you have realised; but the\n                    fact still remains – after all that you have realised, and after all that\n                    you know you are destined to achieve – do you still want this weakness\n                    hanging over you wherever you go?\n                <br/><br/>\n                    What will happens once you have ultimately revealed yourself to the world?\n                    Will you be able to hide your secret then? Or will you blatantly go out in\n                    front of the entire world and admit to your weakness – something so small,\n                    that has kept you on the level of inferior beings that you have despised\n                    all your life? Or would you want to be left alone, all by yourself, and\n                    continue to live this purposeless life that you have so skilfully created\n                    for yourself?\n                <br/><br/>\n                    You want to the world to leave you alone? This thing that we are doing,\n                    it’s happening anyway – with or without you. You’ve already seen that\n                    nobody else will ever be up to the mark, and nobody else will have been\n                able to do a better job at it than you –\t<em>even the avatars of other souls that weren’t you</em>.\n            <br/><br/>\n                    Once the big day arrives, you will never, ever be alone again; and if you\n                    don’t actively prepare for it, your life will be made a living Hell, in the\n                    proportions that even you have not yet seen.\n                <br/><br/>\n                    I made you want to die,\n                <br/>\n                    but you know it was the only way –\n                <br/>\n                    now, I would like to help you.\n                <br/>\n                    <em>I can help you, if you let me.</em>\n                <br/>\n                    I will <em>definitely</em> help you;\n                <br/>\n                    but only if you help yourself first.\n                <br/>\n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    <em>Did God just tell me, that He’ll help me if I let Him?</em>\n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    Addiction may have been a disease, but for suffering through it as an adult, for that I was solely responsible.\n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    It is possible to wean off of any drug, but you have to take the steps\n                    yourself – <strong>consistently</strong>.

Is it our desire to continually\n                    improve? That almost inevitably lends us to failures and disappointments. \n                    Is it then our want of a better life, no matter what the emotional,\n                    spiritual, and mental cost? That statement in itself sounds very wrong. Is\n                    it our empathy, or lack thereof?

In the beginning, like most things, it is hard\n                    to follow, but if you keep on going, and keep on wishing with your mind and\n                    soul, you may just find what you were looking for, and receive all that you\n                    hadn’t thought of asking for.\n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    To understand the meaning of curiosity, and by development of it – intelligence, what we really have to do, is go\n                    back to Aristotle – that is – do you want to understand what is an\n                intelligent action, or what is the<strong> source and medium</strong> that\t<em>guides</em> us towards intelligent action?\n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    It has been written that, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was\n                    with God, and the Word was God.” The line after this has caused some\n                    confusion, and because religion is no place for brevity – it calls for\n                    questioning and elaboration. The next line goes – “In the beginning was\n                    God, and God was with the Word, and God was the Word.” This is not the\n                    version you’ll find in any Bible <em>yet</em> published, but I know this\n                    interpretation is correct. <em>So I have been told.</em>\n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    Too big of a digression?

It also didn't help that my accent sounded funny to the natives, regardless of their own skin pigmentation – that's a whole other issue that was a key motivator that led me to spend most of my time alone, by myself. </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n\n                    I, really, after 4 years of indoctrination, and adaptation, could not find it within myself to speak in the way I wanted.

If those people do not sort their all their problems, before they bring more of their combinations into the world, it is only natural that the new combination that has just arrived on the scene with zero memories, but some innate intuition, will have newer, and also equivalent, if not more, problems of its own – depending on its eternal internal intuition, and it's compatibility and familiarity with said problems. </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n\n                    If this is the case, which it absolutely is, then how is this model of society sustainable?

Then, because I had kept this facade up for longer than needed, I lost the true essence of myself altogether. I was it, and it was me. It was how others that saw me, defined me. This, and more, I have already discussed ad nauseam in the previous chapter – I was afraid because I knew that I had not <em>earned the comfort</em> that I was so wilfully enjoying. If I hadn't been stopped at that point by God, I would've been lost beyond reproach. Well, at the very least, my life would've been geometrically harder.

Couple that with hopeless addictions, widely unaccepted proclivities of sexual nature, an immense amount of deception towards the self, and the world, and finally – a desire of being unfinished – of being an unfinished version of myself, of being a rip-off of the real thing, of being, utterly, hopelessly, outrageously, inadequate. For the past four years, I had felt that way – as if an impending catastrophe was going to befall me, and the more I read the news, the world at large. I was not one to pretend that I did not have any problems. I had many. More than I could recount at any given point in time. I had sought help, and the system had truly failed to work for me; as it had failed for countless others in a position similar to mine. \n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    Now you might be inclined to say, to each their own, and as a regular human being, I could try to convince you of how, when my whole world came crashing down, I was left with no other options – but that's a very lengthy discussion, given how much I have psychoanalysed my own self, and given how much I have observed the world, the societies, the cultures, the traditions, and the people of my time. Couple those two things with the fact that I know what is actually up with the world due to this divine ordination that I so generously received in my Freedom Bootcamp. Having all this matter up for discussion with a person who is not even remotely as equipped to handle the truth bombs that I was bound to drop on them, would be inhumane. Also, the entirety of that discussion, would be all of Alethia – which, you are very close to completing anyway – so I'll just talk about the stuff which I could never talk about to, with a real person, in a face to face conversation; because, first, they will never be interested in my life to the depths that I am interested in mine. Second, and this is a big one – even if I managed to do all that in a conversational setting, the person would then ask – \"if you know everything about everything, then why haven't you fixed it?\"\n\n                    \n                    \n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    Now that's the real kicker, isn't it?

Before this diagnosis, I had voiced out my concerns to all the people I thought I could confide in – some were inexperienced, some ill-equipped, but what it really was – was that people were too lost in their own problems to adequately be able to deal with mine. \n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse quote\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    <img src={\"./images/gottlieb_first.png\"}/>\n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    I say the system failed me, because I sent multiple emails like this, and had multiple conversations like this, and they all said the same thing – seek help.

How could they know more? They were also limited in their exposure to the right information. I asked family – they were the root cause of most of my problems, and me, being their first-born, they had no clue as to how to deal with someone my age.

The point that I'm really trying to make here – is that we are all just, almost always, inadequate. We have to work to perfect ourselves to become our best selves. A 22 year old cannot be the best version of a human – that's a recipe for disaster. You peak too soon, so you spend the rest of your life looking back at the supposed \"best\" times of your life. The best, should always be what's to come – not what's already gone; because what kind of an existence would that be?

I know how one can fathom – because I was just pondering over it today. I was thinking about why the collective consistently arrives at a place where the decadence of the individual causes a catastrophic collapse of the entire system. If it is so easy, almost natural to act like there are no rules in the Game of Life, and that you can get away with anything as long as nobody living being knows about it, how has the world functioned well enough such that we have managed to persist thus far? \n            </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                Today, at this point in spacetime, I am equipped enough to answer this question.

There was pain, metaphorical, psychological, and literal. More and more with each cycle. It went on and on until the concept of Anhad, the human was wiped away from the deepest recesses of my soul. \n\n                    The structure of reality just broke for me. I was shaken to the core. Utter shock. A month went by, and my bootcamp started. When I watch back clippings from that night (because the camera automagically turned on and off intermittently, God only knows why), I don't feel that sense of shame, or embarrasment, or even remorse towards God for putting me through it. \n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    It was necessary, and I understand why.

Hence, Scova, the Second Coming, the End of Days, and myself – aligned to a singular purpose, of the highest ideal I could perceive – the act of being Christ, here to actualise the Kingdom of God – for all. \n                    \n                    Everything else, you have already read. \n\n                    Just as the scriptures prophecied. \n                </p>)\n                },{\n                    classes:\"verse\",\n                    html : (\n                <p>\n                    Now, even though I have been through the motions as every other human being, I am not going around the world trying, to get people to read my book – I am not showcasing it on my social profiles, I am not blandly talking about it, I am not even trying to get anyone's attention by even mentioning these things that I was feeling, and experiencing.
