Do you go around the world looking for answers, or do you keep\n        looking inwards? Do you take advice of learned elders, or ask an\n        innocent child? Do you embed yourself in fervent calculations, or just\n        toss a coin and be done with it? Do you trust your internal instinct, or\n        do you analyse every known variable cerebrally?
