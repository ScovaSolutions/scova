        Exams went by nicely, all things considered. Unsurprisingly, I failed
        Linear Algebra, and had to repeat the course over the summer, with the

        ecstatic-about-graduation posts across all my social channels. Of
        course, my posts were just a continuation of my ongoing

        Three odd things did happen which I have managed to remember to this
        day. The first one being the unavailability of LSD, but also, of time to
        indulge in such a long trip that required a good portion of the day, and
        left you so exhausted that you really had to set aside a whole weekend
        for just a single trip. I usually had the luxury for such indulgences
        when I easily cancelled plans with the "boys." To be really honest, I
        wasn't very keen on calling LSD an indulgence at that moment. At the
        time, it was more of a life-exploration, mind-expanding treatment that I
        was flirting with. The <em>Glimpse</em> had happened on what was essentially my
        sixth acid trip.

        getting me a job somewhere not in the US. I was most definitely not
        ready to go home yet, or ever. I may have seen Nanak's face, but that
        really didn't change anything. I had written that article, but that

        The second odd thing was very miniscule, something which I would've

        champagne to celebrate his admission into a prestigious MBA program, funnily enough, 
        depending on your humour preferences, it was at the university I had once envisioned 
        myself being at. This was hardly surprising, given that he was genuinely book-smart. I

        introspective adventure, whose meaning, I had no way of explaining. I
        began to talk anyway. I started off with declaring that I wasn't

        trip, because then he would know why I had missed our Senior Formal.

        A couple of obvious things stand out to me now, when this incident has

        The first being, that my father was only called at, because of his
        perceived difference. Had he not been wearing a turban, the crowd would
        not have realised that we were different from them, and hence, would not
        have had any reason to bother a family to partake in their diversion.
        The second being, that he was called at, with full knowledge that he was
        essentially the same as them, as our religion was associated with the
        province of Punjab, and hence, the dance of bhangra was native to us.
        The third being, that he was called out with kind salutations of "ji,"
        which is used when you are referring to someone respectfully. Fourth,
        the use of the term "sardar," which, initially adopted for its revered
        stature, was now often used in a derogatory context, alluding to the
        supposed stereotype of a stupid-sardar, who couldn't understand the

        It is weird, that this idea of the simpleton sardar originated towards
        the end of Mughal India, almost definitely during the period of
        annexation of Delhi which was spearheaded by the Iranian Muslim ruler,
        Nader Shah. The story goes, that around the year 1739 AD, the Shah's men
        were not only looting treasures during their conquests, but also taking
        Hindu women hostage. Sardar Jassa Singh, commander of the Sikh army at
        that time, decided to attack Nader Shah???s troops at midnight. It began a
        series of extractions, where the Sikh army would attack Muslim raiders
        at midnight, and bring back the women to their homes. That whole series
        of occurrences began a smear campaign, probably starting off as a
        deprecating joke arising out of insecurity and contempt, about sardars
        going mad at midnight. To this day, turbaned sikhs, all over the world
        have to be the butt of those jokes about being stupid, especially more
        so, when the clock is about to strike 12.

        I mention this, not to gain sympathy, certainly not to reignite
        religious tensions ??? 11 year old me was mightily affected by the riots
        that broke out in the city on the day we were scheduled to leave
        Pakistan, than by this minor brush with discrimination. Markets were
        closed, not a single uninvolved bystander was to be seen, every turn we
        took just led to a wall of lynching crowd ??? cracking windows, and
        burning tyres. My father had to remove his turban, and my sisters were
        hidden from outside view. Who knows what their issue was at the time,
        but years later when I recounted this issue to a Pakistani friend of
        mine, he scoffed "unka roz ka hai, aap hamare ghar aaye, khatirdaari

        mentioned that we were well-off. Perhaps I wanted to incite a certain
        amount of dissonance in you? Maybe. Really though, I wanted to point out
        the intricate irrationality that is reflected in each of our ignorant
        actions, especially more so in the case of discrimination, positive or
        negative. Think about all the different ways in which we have to alter
        the flow of our regular routines to accommodate others who aren't aware
        of the implications of their own actions. I'm absolutely sure, that
        there isn't a single person on this planet, who has not faced
        discrimination ??? it is the baggage that we inherited, but were not born
        with. Isn't it time to let that go? We are all the same here. Why don't
        we treat each other well? What's the point of enemity when all known

        is not a problem. Sure. You cannot survive normally without oxygen, or
        water. That???s alright. Nature has meant for it to be that way. Tobacco
        is natural, so is marijuana, as are the grapes used to ferment wine. The

        drugs. The first part around their over consumption, and the next around
        their over aversion. Neither works. Sometimes you want drugs, sometimes
        you need them. Sex is a drug. Pleasure itself is a drug. In their true
        form, they are all just molecular interactions with internal bodily
        chemistry that gives you a sensation of being <em>more </em>alive. I say
        more, because the humdrum life in most moments doesn???t feel like being
        alive. Adrenalin is a drug. Productivity is a rush. Escapism is a rush.
        Every upper is a rush that excites, and every downer is a rush that
        mellows, all very potent in their own right. At the time of writing this
        text, I don???t think I could ever be fit enough to judge another human
        being for partaking in the use of drugs, whatever their kind may be

        wounded that the physical pain of it was merely a welcome excuse at that
        point. This was like that, even more hard hitting since this one time in
        college I was so drunk that I just fell face first, and broke two teeth
        in the center of my face. I was so drunk that I couldn't use my hands to
        break my fall. I had taken the Irish-exit out of this houseparty that I
        wasn't enjoying at all, somehow ended up in an under-construction
        apartment complex, come out a window onto the scaffolding, recorded an
        embarrassing video, gone back into a different apartment, and been
        kicked out by an unsuspecting old woman. That night was like a weird
        dream, that leaves you scatter-brained for days, and I had literal
        proofs of its occurence. I had had way too many nights like that, and so
        I wasn't just a metaphor of a disaster, my life was a literal example.

        As the psychedelic started to kick in, and the music seemed to be
        getting more involved, my body started to adapt to the vibrations, and
        moved along with it, as a surfer riding a wave. These vibrations, almost
        started to slip away through my body, and in the moment, the only way I
        could keep riding was if I played chords of sorts on a stringed
        instrument. It was equivalent to playing air-guitar, but instead of my
        palm being rolled inwards, and towards my own self, in the moment, it
        felt more intuitive to focus the face of my palm on the hardwood floor

        song, so it was in the playlist. The repetitive lyrics in the beginning
        of the song got me focused on that specific spot on the floor, and I

        The answer is neither. The previous books that were written, didn???t just
        contain banal salutations, and pointless incantations ??? certainly not in
        the very beginning. The authors of the book made God easily accessible
        by providing you with the most important information in the very
        beginning. Practicing religious friends of mine have even scoffed at me
        for even thinking of reading a scripture, any scripture, in its
        entirety. What a weird thing to discourage! Why wouldn???t you want to

        Sure enough, events started to occur in my life to facilitate my
        thinking, and nudge me towards writing this chapter in a way I knew
        best, and was now, properly equipped to execute. It's only a bonus then,
        if readers are enticed into reading Scova because of my personal story,
        and not despite it. To do that, I could find no other event that has
        pivoted my life in a way that my Judgement Day did. It is definitely not
        something that should've been brushed over, and so I certainly will not
        be providing a sanitised account of events. I will, however, leave room
        for interpretation, only so that someone in this position in a later
        spacetime can rewrite the story with their own narrative. Hopefully
        scribes after my time will not alter anything in Scova to suit their own

        habits that disrupt the cyclic flow of the force of life, are almost

        This is the reason human beings like mechanical, almost mindless tasks

        it to a machine, or delegate it to a subordinate. Why do we let go of a

          Hi there! You've reached the end of the first half of Scova, which is
          titled The Aleithyan Journey, and for now, I'm not writing any more of my story, I
          have yet to live it! The next volume will be called Neeti, and I will
          begin that after I get married. Until then, if you would like to have
          a chat, I'd suggest you to connect with me directly at
          <strong> anhad@scova.org</strong>, or look me up on any social
          platforms.
